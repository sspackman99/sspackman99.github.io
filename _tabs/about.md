# About Me

My name is Sam Spackman and I am finishing the last year of my undergraduate degree at Brigham Young University studying statistics. I am a *total* data nerd, I'm always smiling and laughing, and I'm probably too loud for my own good.

### That's why I started this blog

 -- So that I could share what I know about data science with you, my faithful data-nerd companions and not hurt your eardrums while I'm at it.
