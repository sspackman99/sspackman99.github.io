My name is Sam Spackman and I am an absolute data science junkie.

I am a *total* data nerd. I love to discuss with people how they can improve their own data science workflows, gain insights from their data that they didn't realize they could learn, or just blab about the field in general.

### That's why I started this blog

-- To prove wrong everyone who thinks that to become an effective data scientist you have to be a really smart mathmetician born with incredible computational skills or have a natural knack for programming. I'm nothing like that, I'm a normal everyday person just like everyone else.. but I have a passion for data and statistics, a passion that is helping me prove that with hard work and determination anyone can become a data scientist.

### Be prepared for magic
