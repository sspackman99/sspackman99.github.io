# About Me

My name is Sam Spackman and I am finishing the last year of my undergraduate degree at Brigham Young University in Utah studying statistics and preparing to enter graduate school.

I am a *total* data nerd, I'm always smiling and laughing, and I'm probably too loud for my own good.

Some of my favorite hobbies include...

Rock climbing

and canyoneering

Or really anything that's outdoors! I also lived in the Visayas region of the Philippines for a couple years, so the Philippines really has my heart.

### That's why I started this blog

-- To prove wrong everyone who thinks that to become an effective data scientist you have to be a really smart mathmetician born with incredible computational skills or have a natural knack for programming. I'm nothing like that, I'm a normal everyday person just like everyone else.. but I have a passion for data and statistics, a passion that is helping me prove that with hard work and determination anyone can become a data scientist.
